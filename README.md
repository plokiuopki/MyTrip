# MyTrip
Trip Planner project: 

Accomplished 11/1:

-Cleaned up the airfare (removed and improved syntax because there were two methods being called for the same thing)

-Cleaned up the date format so that user is limited to only inputting real dates

-Added the option for additional travelers and scaled expenses in each class so that it would increase cost based on the traveler amount

-Added the option to book multiple hotel rooms

For Monday (when I will continue working):

-Will consider adding a dinning option on Monday (perhaps giving the user an option to select from the top 2 or 3 restaurants in each location) (just considering not sure yet if it is worth adding)

Comments for the team:

-After we complete everything, we can go back and consider rewriting the code using data structures and algorithms.  For now, keep the code simple so that it is working properly because it is much easier to convert working code into a new structure than it is to try to use a data structure and algorithm with no code to reference.

-Im signing off for the day.  MAKE SURE TO DOWNLOAD the new code I just added so that we donâ€™t lose anything, as you are making your updates over the weekend.
